// TableConfig assumes that when specifying the column types for a DB table,
// it is enough to use strings and integers. Also a primary key is assumed
// and foreign keys are allowed. Any field can be nil, except the first
// (tableName). Obviously the two fields "int*" should be the same length,
// and also the two fields "str*".
//
// Date-time's are not an issue for SQLite, since either a string or an int
// can be used. We will favor using strings ("TEXT"), which are expected to
// be ISO-8601 / RFC 3339. It is the first option listed here:
// https://www.sqlite.org/datatype3.html#date_and_time_datatype:
//  - TEXT: "YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS.SSS" (or with "T" in the blank position).
//  - REAL as Julian day numbers: the day count since 24 November 4714 BC.
//  - INTEGER as Unix time: the seconds count since 1970-01-01 00:00:00 UTC.
